      question: "What is SQL?",
      answer: "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.",
      category: "Basics"
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      question: "What is a primary key?",
      answer: "A primary key is a field (or combination of fields) that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It cannot contain NULL values and must have unique entries.",
      category: "Keys"
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      question: "What is a foreign key?",
      answer: "A foreign key is a field (or combination of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.",
      category: "Keys"
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "What are constraints in SQL?",
      answer: "Constraints are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity. Common constraints include: PRIMARY KEY (uniquely identifies each record), FOREIGN KEY (enforces referential integrity), UNIQUE (ensures all values in a column are distinct), CHECK (ensures that values in a column satisfy a specific condition), NOT NULL (ensures a column cannot have NULL values), DEFAULT (specifies a default value for a column).",
      category: "Constraints"
    },

    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?",
      answer: "DELETE: Removes rows from a table based on a condition. It can be rolled back (transaction-safe) and triggers can be invoked. TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table, resetting the identity column. It is faster but cannot be rolled back and does not invoke triggers.",
      category: "DML Commands"
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      question: "How do you find the maximum salary from an employees table?",

      code: "SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees\nWHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);",

    {
      id: 9,
      question: "What is a JOIN? Explain its types.",
      answer: "A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Types of joins: INNER JOIN (returns rows with matching values in both tables), LEFT JOIN (returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right), RIGHT JOIN (returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left), FULL JOIN (returns rows when there is a match in either table), CROSS JOIN (returns the Cartesian product of both tables).",
      category: "Joins"
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      question: "Write a query to fetch employee names and department names using JOIN.",

    },
    {
      id: 11,
      question: "What is a GROUP BY clause in SQL?",

      explanation: "This query groups employees by department_id and counts the number of employees in each department.",
      category: "Grouping"
    },
    {
      id: 13,
      question: "What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?",
      answer: "WHERE: Filters rows before grouping (applies to individual rows). HAVING: Filters groups after the GROUP BY clause (applies to aggregate functions).",
      category: "Filtering"
    },
    {
      id: 14,
      question: "Write a query to fetch departments with more than 5 employees.",

    },
    {
      id: 16,
      question: "What is a subquery in SQL?",
      answer: "A subquery is a query nested within another query. It is used to retrieve data that will be passed into the outer query.",
      category: "Subqueries"
    },
    {
      id: 17,
      question: "Write a query to find all employees whose salary is greater than the average salary.",

    },
    {
      id: 21,
      question: "What is normalization? Explain its types (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).",
      answer: "Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Forms: 1NF (Eliminate duplicate columns and create tables for related data), 2NF (Remove partial dependencies - columns depend on a part of a composite key), 3NF (Remove transitive dependencies - non-key columns depend on other non-key columns), BCNF (A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant must be a candidate key).",
      category: "Database Design"
